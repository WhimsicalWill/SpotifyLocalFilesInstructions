# SpotifyLocalFilesInstructions

# Introduction
Sometimes it is convenient to be able to listen to local files within Spotify. In these instructions, I will show you how to get .mp3 files from the internet (soundcloud, youtube, etc.), and upload them to your Spotify account for easy listening on your phone, computer, or potato.

# Find a song that you like
Note: There is almost always a way to download music from different streaming services on the internet, but I will specifically show you how to download songs from youtube and soundcloud. Find a song that you like from youtube or soundcloud.

# Downloading the music
For youtube, there are many services, but [this]https://ytmp3.cc/en13/ should be fine. For soundcloud, I've used [this site]https://sctomp3.net/ in the past. You should stick to just using the website, as there is no real benefit to downloading an application for converting to these .mp3 files.


# Uploading local files to Spotify
This part must be done using the desktop version of spotify, but I will show you how to get these local files synced to your phone in the next section. To let Spotify see local files, go to settings, and in the Local Files section, enable Show Local Files. Then, click the button Add A Source below, and select the folder that you downloaded your music to.

# Adding local files to playlists
Once Spotify detects your local files, they will be available within the desktop application on the left sidebar in the Local Files part of Your Library. You can now listen to them and add them to different playlists.

# Syncing local Files with phone
Spotify has a kind of weird way of doing this, but here's what they recommend:
1. First, on your computer, add your local files to a playlist.
2. On your phone, go to settings in the Spotify app and turn Local audio files on.
3. Connect your computer to the same wifi as your phone.
4. On your phone, download the playlist that you added the local files to

After doing this, your files should sync and you should be able to listen to your music on your phone.
